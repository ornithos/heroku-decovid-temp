# decovid-stats-AWDG

The goal of this work is to create summary statistics and visualisations (possibly interactive) that serves as a useful first view of the DECOVID data in the safe haven. This will include:

* Defining the standard data queries.
* Implementing the queries within [ACHILLES](https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles/).
* Creating some bespoke dashboards (most likely in `dash`).
* Productionisation of the above.
