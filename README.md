# heroku upload of sketch OMOP dashboard

We want more flexibility than [AchillesWeb](https://github.com/OHDSI/AchillesWeb/) can provide. This is an experiment using `Dash` to create a dashboard from the outputs of the [Achilles](https://github.com/OHDSI/Achilles/) tools.

This is a copy of the `decovid-ADWG-stats` repository to experiment with heroku hosting. I don't want to pollute the original repository with these details for the time being.
